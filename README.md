# About Wayfarer

A mental health and self-improvement app built for the web. Using best practices in healthy communication, Hivemind enables users to add contacts from their real-life support networks, build a well-worded request with our tool that helps each user figure out exactly what they are feeling and what they need in that moment, and then seamlessly send that request as a text message to their contact/s of choice. Users can track emotional trends and access additional resources to build healthy habits after generating data about themselves through the app.
